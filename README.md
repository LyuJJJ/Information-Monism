See attached PDF for the full manuscript (December 2025).

Abstract: 
A speculative framework proposing that reality, virtuality, humans, AI, and black holes are phases of a single informational process. Using a three-level information hierarchy and a coupling parameter κ, it links complexity growth to holography and cosmic expansion.

Keywords: Foundations of quantum theory -- Cosmological parameters -- Artificial Intelligence -- Philosophy of cosmology
